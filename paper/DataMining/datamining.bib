The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of in-text citations in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed in-text citations in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age), and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics. The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple times.},

	abstract = {Eponyms are known to praise leading scientists for their contributions to science. Some are so widespread that they are even known by laypeople (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Darwinism). However, there is no systematic way to discover the distributions of eponyms in scientific domains. Prior work has tackled this issue but has failed to address it completely. Early attempts involved the manual labelling of all eponyms found in a few textbooks of given domains, such as chemistry. Others relied on search engines to probe bibliographic records seeking a single eponym at a time, such as Nash Equilibrium. Nonetheless, we failed to find any attempt of eponym quantification in a large volume of full-text publications. This article introduces a semi-automatic text mining approach to extracting eponyms and quantifying their use in such datasets. Candidate eponyms are matched programmatically by regular expressions, and then validated manually. As a case study, the processing of 821 recent Scientometrics articles reveals a mixture of established and emerging eponyms. The results stress the value of text mining for the rapid extraction and quantification of eponyms that may have substantial implications for research evaluation.},

This article presents a potential solution: an empirical approach to quantitatively measure both the degree and nature of differences among disciplinary tongues through the social and epistemic terms used (a research area we refer to as discourse epistemetrics), in a case study comparing dissertations in philosophy, psychology, and physics. Using a support-vector model of machine learning to classify disciplines based on relative frequencies of social and epistemic terms, we were able to markedly improve accuracy over a random selection baseline (distinguishing between disciplines with as high as 90\% accuracy) as well as acquire sets of most indicative terms for each discipline by their relative presence or absence. These lists were then considered in light of findings of sociological and epistemological studies of disciplines and found to validate the approach's measure of social and epistemic disciplinary identities and contrasts. Based on the findings of our study, we conclude by considering the beneficiaries of research in this area, including bibliometricians, students, and science policy makers, among others, as well as laying out a research program that expands the number of disciplines, considers shifts in socio-epistemic identities over time and applies these methods to nonacademic epistemological communities (e.g., political groups).},

In particular, we describe our dataset for citation polarity and citation purpose, present experimental results on the automatic detection of these indicators, and demonstrate the use of such annotations for studying research dynamics and scientific summarization. We also look at two complementary problems that show up in Natural-Language-Processing-driven citation analysis for a specific target paper. The first problem is extracting citation context, the implicit citation sentences that do not contain explicit anchors to the target paper. The second problem is extracting reference scope, the target relevant segment of a complicated citing sentence that cites multiple papers. We show how these tasks can be helpful in improving sentiment analysis and citation-based summarization.},

Existing bibliometric measures provide “quantitative ” indicators of how good a published paper is. This does not necessarily reflect the “quality ” of the work presented in the paper. For example, when h-index is computed for a researcher, all incoming citations are treated equally, ignoring the fact that some of these citations might be negative. In this paper, we propose using {NLP} to add a “qualitative ” aspect to biblometrics. We analyze the text that accompanies citations in scientific articles (which we term citation context). We propose supervised methods for identifying citation text and analyzing it to determine the purpose (i.e. author intention) and the polarity (i.e. author sentiment) of citation. 1},

This article studies the evolution of the aging phenomenon and, in particular, how the age of cited literature has changed over more than 100 years of scientific activity. It shows that the average and median ages of cited literature have undergone several changes over the period. Specifically, both World War I and World War {II} had the effect of significantly increasing the age of the cited literature. The major finding of this article is that contrary to a widely held belief, the age of cited material has risen continuously since the mid-1960s. In other words, during that period, researchers were relying on an increasingly old body of literature. Our data suggest that this phenomenon is a direct response to the steady-state dynamics of modern science that followed its exponential growth; however, we also have observed that online preprint archives such as {arXiv} have had the opposite effect in some subfields.},

Existing citation analysis methods assume that all citations in a paper are equally important, and they simply count the number of citations. Here we argue that the citations in a paper are not equally important and some citations are more important than the others. We use a strength value to assess the importance of each citation and propose to use the regression method with a few useful features for automatically estimating the strength value of each citation. Evaluation results on a manually labeled data set in the computer science field show that the estimated values can achieve good correlation with human-labeled values. We further apply the estimated citation strength values for evaluating paper influence and author influence, and the preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness of the citation strength values.},

However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.},

Coercive self-citation refers to requests that (i) give no indication that the manuscript was lacking in attribution; (ii) make no suggestion as to specific articles, authors, or a body of work requiring review; and (iii) only guide authors to add citations from the editor's journal. This quote from an editor as a condition for publication highlights the problem: “you cite Leukemia [once in 42 references]. Consequently, we kindly ask you to add references of articles published in Leukemia to your present article” (6).

Validity of citation counting is empirically analyzed with reference to random samples of English and German journal articles as well as German textbooks, encyclopedias, and test-manuals from psychology. Results show that 25\% of all citations are perfunctory, more than 50\% of references are journal articles and up to 40\% are books and book-chapters, 10\% are self-references. Differences between publications from various psychological sub-disciplines, publication languages, and types of publication are weak. Thus, validity of evaluative citation counting is limited because at least one quarter refers to perfunctory citations exhibiting a very low information utility level and by the fact that existing citation-databases refer to journal articles only.},

After a manual screening process to remove non-discoveries, a list of over 100 discoveries and their associated articles is compiled and characterized by subject matter and by type of discovery. The phenomenon of multiple discovery is shown to play an important role. The onset and timing of recognition of the articles are studied by comparing the number of citing sentences with and without discovery terms, and show both early onset and delays in recognition. A comparative analysis of the vocabularies of the discovery and non-discovery sentences reveals the types of words and concepts that scientists associate with discoveries. A machine learning application is used to efficiently extend the list. Implications of the findings for understanding the nature and justification of scientific discoveries are discussed.},

These inter-article relationships reinforce the argumentation structure intrinsic to all scientific writing. Therefore, determining the nature of the exact relationship between a citing and cited paper requires an understanding of the rhetorical relations within the argumentative context in which a citation is placed. To determine these relations automatically, we have suggested that various stylistic and rhetorical cues will be significant. One such cue that we are studying is the use of hedging to modify the affect of a scientific claim. We provide evidence that hedging occurs more frequently in citation contexts than in the text as a whole. With this information we conjecture that hedging is a significant aspect of the rhetorical structure of citation contexts and that the pragmatics of hedges may help in determining the rhetorical purpose of citations.

	abstract = {Algorithms are ubiquitous in the computer science literature. A search engine for algorithms has been tested as part of the {CiteseerX} suite; however, it only retrieves algorithms whose metadata is textually matched with the search query. Such a limitation occurs because a traditional search engine does not have the ability to understand what algorithms are and how they work. Here, we present an initial effort in understanding the semantics of algorithms. Specifically, we identify how an existing algorithm can be used in scholarly works and propose a classification scheme for algorithm function.},

	abstract = {In citation network analysis, complex behavior is reduced to a simple edge, namely, node A cites node B. The implicit assumption is that A is giving credit to, or acknowledging, B. It is also the case that the contributions of all citations are treated equally, even though some citations appear multiply in a text and others appear only once. In this study, we apply text-mining algorithms to a relatively large dataset (866 information science articles containing 32,496 bibliographic references) to demonstrate the differential contributions made by references. We (1) look at the placement of citations across the different sections of a journal article, and (2) identify highly cited works using two different counting methods ({CountOne} and {CountX}). We find that (1) the most highly cited works appear in the Introduction and Literature Review sections of citing papers, and (2) the citation rankings produced by {CountOne} and {CountX} differ. That is to say, counting the number of times a bibliographic reference is cited in a paper rather than treating all references the same no matter how many times they are invoked in the citing article reveals the differential contributions made by the cited works to the citing paper.},

	title = {Citations: Indicators of Quality? The Impact Fallacy},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08452},
	shorttitle = {Citations},
	abstract = {We argue that citation is a composed indicator: short-term citations can be considered as currency at the research front, whereas long-term citations can contribute to the codification of knowledge claims into concept symbols. Knowledge claims at the research front are more likely to be transitory and are therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality, but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish papers at a research front, unlike, for example, {JACS}; (2) Robert Merton as a concept symbol across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-{RPYS} ("Multi-Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy") of the journals Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the measurement of "quality" in terms of citations can further be qualified: short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from longer-term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims into bodies of knowledge. The recently introduced Multi-{RPYS} can be used to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts.},

	abstract = {This article considers the notion of academic vocabulary: the assumption that students of English for academic purposes ({EAP}) should study a core of high frequency words because they are common in an English academic register. We examine the value of the term by using Coxhead's (2000) Academic Word List ({AWL}) to explore the distribution of its 570 word families in a corpus of 3.3 million words from a range of academic disciplines and genres. The findings suggest that although the {AWL} covers 10.6\% of the corpus, individual lexical items on the list often occur and behave in different ways across disciplines in terms of range, frequency, collocation, and meaning. This result suggests that the {AWL} might not be as general as it was intended to be and, more importandy, questions the widely held assumption that students need a single core vocabulary for academic study. We argue that the different practices and discourses of disciplinary communities undermine the usefulness of such lists and recommend that teachers help students develop a more restricted, discipline-based lexical repertoire.},

\section{Introduction}

The citation constitutes one of the most basic unit of analysis in the fields of bibliometrics, scientometrics, and quantitative study of science. The h-index ~\cite{hirsch_index_2005}, journal-impact factor ~\cite{garfield_citation_1955}, and other evaluative tools have emerged from these disciplines and been put into widespread us. For better or worse, bibliometric indicators are now ubiquitous in the scientific ecosystem. Google Scholar publicly displays a an author’s h-index, most journals feature their journal impact factor prominently on their homepages, and universities use tools from companies like Academic Analytics that use citations to benchmark a department’s research performance. 

Given their present importance, it is worrisome that citation-count based metrics often fail as indicators of quality~\cite{leydesdorff_citations:_2016}. One criticism of citation-based evaluation (of many) is that citations do not necessarily represent an endorsement of a past work, but may instead reflect a host of other “non-scientific” meanings~\cite{bornmann_what_2006}. Bibliometric researchers have long attempted to create classification frameworks that capture the diversity of citation meanings~\cite{moravcsik_results_1975}, but such schemes have tended to require intensive manual effort. That the nature of citations cannot be determined at scale remains a pressing concern for any citation-based evaluation.

More recently, computational and natural language processing experts have developed techniques to automatically classify citations using in-text features and publication metadata ~\cite{jha_nlp-driven_2017}. Such studies have attempted to classify citations based on their supposed function ~\cite{teufel_automatic_2006}, sentiment~\cite{catalini_incidence_2015}, and importance ~\cite{valenzuela_identifying_2015}, and have attempted to address the technical, rather than social or theoretical issues. Despite some progress made by these researchers, citation classification remains an open and contentious problem.

The field of automatic citation classification have thus far opted for a “top-down” approach to the development of classification frameworks. However, these approaches have necessitated that researchers impose a model of citation onto their data, models which vary greatly between individual researchers and disciplines. Thus far, studies of automatic citation classification has produced little to no consensus on a best model or approach to citation classification. However, the massive quantities of structured full-text data of scientific publications that are now available allow for alternative approaches. 

In this study, I use an unsupervised, “bottom-up” approach to the study of the nuances and meanings of in-text citation using full-text data from all publications in the Journal of Informetrics. I employ a series of unsupervised clustering techniques on selected features of these in-text citations with the goal of revealing latent citation types. The features I extract are intended to maximize interpretability, rather than detail and complexity. The findings of this analysis will be used to inform future studies of citation classification.

\section{Meeting Notes}

\subsection{Week 2: 12th November, 2018}
\begin{itemize}
\item Previous week's tasks: wrote R code to process text and extract in-text citation features. Started creating dictionary lists of interesting cue words. Set up github and dropbox files
\item Next week's work: Get a hold of Ken Hyland's work and finish creating dictionary lists. Convert cue-phrase identification to a library that can be easily loaded into an R script. Extract all features and create histograms of each. Extract contextual features from the database (based on author, reference info, etc.). 
\item Blockers: Getting access to the Hyland book. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Previous week's tasks: Gathered literature relating to automatic classification of citation types. Downloaded all relevant data for JOI and placed it onto my local computer. Wrote project introduction and began planning analysis.
\item Current week's tasks: Begin setting up project infrastructure (dropbox, github, etc.). Make list of features to extract and began coding to make it so. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}
The data used in this analysis comes from the Elsevier ScienceDirect database. This dataset was originally obtained by the University of Leiden in 2017, and contains 4,821,774 english-language publications specifically labeled as “full-length article”, “short communication”, or “reviewer article” published between 1980 and 2016. Sentences containing in-text citations have been extracted from the full-text of these articles, and placed into a relational database hosted by the University of Leiden. More information on the Elsevier dataset, including a comparison to the existing PubMed dataset, and a large-scale descriptive analysis, can be found in a recent study by Boyack et al.,  ~\cite{boyack_characterizing_2018}. In this analysis, I focus primarily on the Journal of Informetrics, a journal of relatively small size and of which I am familiar. There are 735 publications in the Journal of Informetrics, which corresponds to around 35,000 sentences containing in-text citations. This provides a manageable and interpretable, though limited dataset; any findings resulting from analysis of this limited data can easily be expanded to other journals and scientific disciplines.
